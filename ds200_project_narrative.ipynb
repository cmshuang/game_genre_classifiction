    "The video game community is quickly growing to become a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide. For new developers and publishers seeking to enter an expanding market, it would be useful to know which video game genres, platforms, and ESRB ratings are the most popular in a certain region. On the consumer side, knowing the genre of enjoyable games can help with the search for more interesting or fun content. In this paper, we seek to discover trends between genre, platform, ESRB rating, and sales in different regions, and then seek to classify a video game genre based on sales data, as well as platform and ESRB rating. The results show that our classification reflects the limitations of current genre classification, and more improvement must be made for this classification to perform sufficiently."

    "Genre classification is not a novel concept -- it has been done, albeit manually, for media such as books, music, television, and movies<sup>4</sup>. However, the video game industry is much newer than these other media sources; as a result, genre classification is often subjective, and some games could be classified under multiple genres<sup>1</sup>. In addition to the industry’s novelty, it is also growing very quickly<sup>2</sup>, suggesting that as the industry expands, community members will find more descriptive names for certain genres, and current classifications could be outdated. Furthermore, a video game’s genre is not necessarily bound to its narrative; interactive components of a video game also contribute to its genre classification<sup>1, 2</sup>. Even with these challenges, perhaps a certain combination of sales and game identifiers could accurately predict a game's genre.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Game identifiers include the platform or console under which it was released, its ESRB rating, and the content descriptors attached to the ESRB rating. The ESRB, or Entertainment Software Rating Board, was developed in the United States to aid parents’ understanding of a game’s safety and content<sup>6</sup>. The rating is defined based on age appropriateness, while content descriptors give information about in-game elements, such as “animated violence” or “gambling.” Perhaps references to certain topics could lend information towards a game’s genre. For example, action games could have content descriptors like “animated violence” or “fantasy violence.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "On the developer side, knowing the relationship between content descriptors, sales, and genre could provide some inspiration for their game development. If a certain genre performs well in a certain region, and that genre typically contains a handful of content descriptors, a developer would be motivated to include those elements in their game. For the average consumer, knowing the relationship between content descriptors and genre could be helpful when it comes to purchasing new titles, as they would likely prefer to play titles with the same genre and therefore similar game elements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This study aims to predict genre from regional and global sales data, game platform, and information retrieved from ESRB ratings, in an attempt to not only overcome the challenges currently associated with video game genre classification, but also to aid members of the gaming community with development and title collection expansion. Prior studies<sup>3</sup> have indicated that action-adventure games are most popular worldwide, and also point to specific genres that are popular in certain countries, i.e. that Germany prefers simulation games. In addition, classification by genre has been done before<sup>4</sup>, albeit on a game’s cover art and description text rather than sales data, platform, and ESRB information. Their results reflected similar inabilities to overcome the challenges mentioned previously.\n"

    "Our goal is to classify games by genre using a random forest. After one-hot encoding the Platform variable, we end up with 84 features of interest (see analysis notebook for list); it would be helpful, then, to project our data into two dimensions, such that we may draw an interpretable decision boundary. This may be done using principal component analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis, commonly abbreviated as PCA, is a statistical method for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. The idea behind PCA is to increase interpretability of datasets with many variables while retaining as much information as possible<sup>5</sup>. We successively create “principal components” from linear combinations of the original features such that variance is maximized and components are orthogonal to one another. This reduces to an eigenvector/eigenvalue problem, where each eigenvector represents the direction of the new axis, and each eigenvalue is a measure of how much variance is explained along that axis. For a dataset of p variables, we have p principal components (PCs). We then drop the PCs that explain the least variance in the data until we have the desired number of dimensions. The result is a projection of our original feature space into a subspace of fewer dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing the PCA transformation, we standardize the variables. Since the method is based on maximizing variance for each principal component, features with large scales would artificially have a greater weight in each component given their naturally high variance. We use sci-kit learn’s StandardScaler class to standardize each variable to mean 0 and variance 1. Using the functions provided by sci-kit learn, we perform PCA on our 84 features of interest. "

    "For this analysis, using PCA to reduce the complexity of our dataset is ineffective. One reason that the first few PC’s could have explained such little variance is that most of the features in the database are one-hot encoded variables. Out of the 84 total variables, only five of them (the sales data in the different regions, and the global sales data) are not one-hot encoded. PCA is a transformation of continuous variables such that each PC is a linear combination of variables that maximizes the variance. However, if the original features are composed of only 0’s and 1’s, then finding a transformation that maximizes variance is very difficult. For the sake of visualization, we have to take only the first two PC’s, which explains only about 10% of the variance in the data, and therefore is not a good representation of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without using PCA, using random forests produces a much higher test accuracy. We choose to use random forests because they solve the overfitting problem that commonly occurs in model fitting methods, such as decision trees. Their only drawback is that this method tends to take a longer time to predict values in the test set; however, that is only a problem when it comes to real-time predictions. With Xudong Zhuang’s suggestion to limit the depth of each decision tree to reduce overfitting even more, our test accuracy with PCA improves about 5%, while it improves only about 1% without PCA. These small accuracy increases suggest that there are broader limitations to genre classification than limit our testing accuracy.\n",
    "Currently, genre classification is limited to a number of circumstances, one of which is that genre classification in the classical sense is applied to more traditional media such as books and movies, none of which include interactive elements the way that video games do1, 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, a single video game could be classified under multiple genres. For example, the popular game Minecraft could be classified as action-adventure, survival, strategy, and sandbox. If our dataset assigns it as “survival” and our random forests classifier predicts it to be ”sandbox,” then it would hurt the test accuracy. Even with these limitations, our classification results are comparable to the results obtained from Jiang et al1, which was about 50%. Although our classification approach cannot directly compare to theirs, both approaches face similar challenges in terms of incorporating those interactive elements and distinguishing between data points with similar features. However, to improve our classification, we need to fundamentally improve the way that we classify video game genres."
