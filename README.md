Angela Hou and Camille Huang

## Abstract
The video game community is quickly growing to become a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide. For new developers and publishers seeking to enter an expanding market, it would be useful to know which video game genres, platforms, and ESRB ratings are the most popular in a certain region. On the consumer side, knowing the genre of enjoyable games can help with the search for more interesting or fun content. In this paper, we seek to discover trends between genre, platform, ESRB rating, and sales in different regions, and then seek to classify a video game genre based on sales data, as well as platform and ESRB rating. The results show that our classification reflects the limitations of current genre classification, and more improvement must be made for this classification to perform sufficiently.
